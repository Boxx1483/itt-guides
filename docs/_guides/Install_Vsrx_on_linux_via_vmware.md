Installing the Vsrx on a linux machine using vmware
===================================================

This guide should only apply to linux distros, considering the process
for install is different depending on the OS.

--
Some prerequirements

1. Vmware installing 10.x or higher

2. As a very minimum 512 MB of ram to spare for the virtual machine

3. A CPU capable of running virtual machines.

First is to get the files needed to mount the vsrx.
In this example I will use the ones from the EAL fronter pages
This version of the Vsrx will be 12.1x

**NOTE this might be different depending on the semesters fronterpage

If there is not access to fronter, getting one from Junipers site is possible,
but with registration.

Go to: oeait17eiC > 1st Semester > Data Communication > Software

If you can't navigate on fronter look below :-)


Inside the fronter page navigate to the section under "Entrance Hall" called: oeait17eiC

Click on the "1st Semester" tab.

Go into the files having the string: oeait17eiC > 1st Semester > Data Communication > Software
